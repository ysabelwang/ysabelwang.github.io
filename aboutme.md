<p style="font-family: avenir;text-align: left;font-size: 14pt">I am a third year PhD candidate studying Physical Oceanography in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program. I'm currently working on mesocale and submesoscale variability in the Northwestern Atlantic, specifically in the Mid-Atlantic Bight where Gulf Stream meanders play a huge role in the oceanography. I use various observations from the region, including hydrography from CTD casts and underway thermosalinographs, shipboard ADCP measurements, long-term CPIES records, and remote sensing datasets.</p>

<p style="font-family: avenir;text-align: left;font-size: 14pt">I was born and raised in Metro Manila, Philippines. Before moving to the US in 2021 to start graduate school, I worked for 3 years as a physical oceanography researcher after receiving a BS in Physics in 2018. In August of 2023 I graduated with a MS in Oceanography from Texas A&M University, where I was advised by  <a href="https://ocean.tamu.edu/people/profiles/faculty/dimarcosteve.html" target="_blank">Steve DiMarco</a>.</p>

 
<p style="font-family: avenir;text-align: left;font-size: 14pt">Outside of school and research, I enjoy playing the guitar, powerlifting, reading, video games, and the occasional pro-wrestling show. I have a mini dachshund named Spamwise Hamgee.</p>
