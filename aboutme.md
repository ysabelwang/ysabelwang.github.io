I am a third year PhD candidate studying Physical Oceanography in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program. I'm currently investigating the cross-scale variability of ocean processes in the Northwestern Atlantic where Gulf Stream meanders play a huge role in the oceanography. 

I was born and raised in Metro Manila, Philippines. Before moving to the US in 2021 to start graduate school, I worked for 3 years as a physical oceanography researcher after receiving a BS in Physics in 2018. In August of 2023 I graduated with a MS in Oceanography from Texas A&M University, where I was advised by  <a href="https://ocean.tamu.edu/people/profiles/faculty/dimarcosteve.html" target="_blank">Steve DiMarco</a>.

Outside of school and research, I enjoy playing the guitar, powerlifting, reading, video games, and the occasional pro-wrestling show. I have a mini dachshund named Spamwise Hamgee.
