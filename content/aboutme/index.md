# <p style="font-family: avenir;text-align: left;font-size: 14pt"><b>Undergrad:</b> I was born and raised in the Philippines, specifically in Metro Manila. In 2018, I graduated from the National Institute of Physics of the University of the Philippines Diliman with a BS in Physics. For my undergraduate thesis, I worked in the Photonics Research Laboratory; a description of my research can be found <a href="https://ysabelwang.github.io/research/research_opticalencryption/" target="_blank">here</a>.

# <p style="font-family: avenir;text-align: left;font-size: 14pt"><b>Work as a research associate:</b> Afterwards, I worked for 3 years at the <a href="https://msi.upd.edu.ph" target="_blank">Marine Science Institute</a> as a research associate in the Physical Oceanography Laboratory, led by <a href="https://msi.upd.edu.ph/faculty/cesar-l-villanoy/" target="_blank">Cesar Villanoy</a>. I participated in a number of field surveys around the Philippines, working on research cruises, piloting autonomous vehicles, setting up HF radar, and developing numerical models. My major project involving <a href = "https://ysabelwang.github.io/research/research_connectivity/" target="_blank">harmful algal bloom dynamics</a> resulted in a <a href="https://ysabelwang.github.io/publication/punongbayan-2022-connections/" target="_blank">publication in the journal <i>Harmful Algae</i></a> of which I am second author.</p>
 
# <p style="font-family: avenir;text-align: left;font-size: 14pt"><b>MS in Texas A&M:</b> In 2021, I moved to the US to begin my MS Oceanography program at Texas A&M University with <a href="https://ocean.tamu.edu/people/profiles/faculty/dimarcosteve.html" target="_blank">Steve DiMarco</a> as my adviser. For two years I worked in the <a href="https://gerg.tamu.edu" target="_blank">Geochemical and Environmental Research Group</a> where I learned a great deal about operational oceanography. On top of being able to work directly and learn from the engineers and techs who work on the <a href = "https://tabs.gerg.tamu.edu/" target="_blank">TABS buoys</a> that monitor the coastal northwestern Gulf of Mexico, I also worked on the software and hardware integration of the university's Liquid Robotics WaveGlider SV3 as part of the <a href="https://oceanacidification.noaa.gov/funded-projects/ocean-acidification-interactions-in-the-gulf-of-mexico/" target="_blank">NOAA Ocean Acidification Program</a>. I was also able to participate in <a href="https://artsci.tamu.edu/news/2022/11/texas-aandm-scientists-keep-watch-as-acidification-threatens-flower-garden-banks-corals.html" target="_blank">research cruises where we deployed and recovered Teledyne Slocum Gliders</a>. After successfully defending my MS thesis on <a href="https://ysabelwang.github.io/research/research_winterstorm/" target="_blank">coastal dense water mass formation during the 2021 Texas winter storms</a>, I graduated in August of 2023. We are currently working on writing up this research.</p>

# <p style="font-family: avenir;text-align: left;font-size: 14pt"><b>PhD in MIT-WHOI JP:</b> In the fall of 2023, I started my PhD in Physical Oceanography at the MIT-WHOI Joint Program with <a href="https://www.whoi.edu/profile/mandres/" target="_blank">Magdalena Andres</a> and <a href="https://www.whoi.edu/science/PO/people/ggg/" target="_blank">Glen Gawarkiewicz</a> as my advisers. In my first two semesters, I have taken/have been taking courses at both MIT and WHOI on fluid dynamics, data analysis methods, large-scale physical oceanography, and computational ocean modelling. I've also been able to start on research, having presented my findings on a <a href="https://ysabelwang.github.io/research/research_wcrs/" target="_blank">Gulf Stream warm core ring</a> at the <a href="https://ysabelwang.github.io/conferences/conferences/202402_osm/" target="_blank">2024 Ocean Sciences Meeting</a>. I'm very interested in the mesoscale and submesoscale processes within the ring and their interactions/links with/to each other, and we continue to investigate these through various data sources.</p>

### About me ###

<p style="font-family: avenir;text-align: left;font-size: 14pt">I am a second year PhD student studying Physical Oceanography in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program, advised by <a href="https://www.whoi.edu/profile/mandres/" target="_blank">Magdalena Andres</a> and <a href="https://www.whoi.edu/science/PO/people/ggg/" target="_blank">Glen Gawarkiewicz</a>. I'm currently working on mesocale and submesoscale variability in the Northwestern Atlantic, specifically in the Mid-Atlantic Bight where Gulf Stream meanders play a huge role in the oceanography. I use various observations from the region, including hydrography from CTD casts and underway thermosalinographs, shipboard ADCP measurements, long-term CPIES records, and remote sensing datasets.</p>

<p style="font-family: avenir;text-align: left;font-size: 14pt">I was born and raised in Metro Manila, Philippines. Before moving to the US in 2021 to start graduate school, I worked for 3 years as a physical oceanography researcher after receiving a BS in Physics in 2018.
