## About Me ##

(will update)

I was born and raised in the Philippines. In 2018, I graduated from the National Institute of Physics of the University of the Philippines Diliman with a BS in Physics. After this, I worked for 3 years at the Marine Science Institute as a research associate in the Physical Oceanography Laboratory, led by Cesar Villanoy.

In 2021, I moved to the US to start my MS Oceanography program at Texas A&M University with Steve DiMarco as my adviser. I graduated in August of 2023.

In the fall of 2023, I started my PhD in Physical Oceanography at the MIT-WHOI Joint Program with Magdalena Andres and Glen Gawarkiewicz as my advisers.

Outside of school and research, I enjoy playing the guitar, powerlifting, reading, video games, and the occasional pro-wrestling show. I also enjoy elaborate methods of preparing my coffee.
