### About me ###
<p style="font-family: avenir">(will update)</p>
 
<p style="font-family: avenir">I was born and raised in the Philippines. In 2018, I graduated from the National Institute of Physics of the University of the Philippines Diliman with a BS in Physics. After this, I worked for 3 years at the <a href="https://msi.upd.edu.ph">Marine Science Institute</a> as a research associate in the Physical Oceanography Laboratory, led by <a href="https://msi.upd.edu.ph/faculty/cesar-l-villanoy/">Cesar Villanoy</a>.</p>
 
<p style="font-family: avenir">In 2021, I moved to the US to start my MS Oceanography program at Texas A&M University with <a href="https://ocean.tamu.edu/people/profiles/faculty/dimarcosteve.html">Steve DiMarco</a> as my adviser. I graduated in August of 2023.</p>
 
<p style="font-family: avenir">In the fall of 2023, I started my PhD in Physical Oceanography at the MIT-WHOI Joint Program with <a href="https://www.whoi.edu/profile/mandres/">Magdalena Andres</a> and <a href="https://www.whoi.edu/science/PO/people/ggg/">Glen Gawarkiewicz</a> as my advisers.</p>
 
<p style="font-family: avenir">Outside of school and research, I enjoy playing the guitar, powerlifting, reading, video games, and the occasional pro-wrestling show. I also enjoy elaborate methods of preparing my coffee.</p>
