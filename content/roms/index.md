# How to get started on ROMS using Poseidon

Last updated: 2024-07-27

## Step 1: Download the ROMS source code

ROMS will be phasing out its subversion (SVN) repository on 2025-01-01, which is what most people up to this point have used to download and compile the ROMS source code. The source code will be made available via Git, and this is what we'll be using here.

*All the instructions we will be following for this step are on the myroms github page: https://github.com/myroms/roms

Prerequisites:
* A Poseidon account
*You do not need to create a ROMS account to download the source code

## Step 2: Testing out the Upwelling case
#### 1. Navigate to where the upwelling test case is located

`cd ~\roms_test\upwelling`
