As of the summer of 2024, I have been digging into data recorded by <a href="https://www.po.gso.uri.edu/dynamics/IES/index.html">Current and Pressure Equipped Inverted Echo Sounders (CPIES)</a>. Six CPIES were deployed in January 2023 east of Cape Hatteras for ~18 months; in June of 2024 we got on the R/V Roger Revelle to pick up 4/6 of them and <a href="https://oceanobservatories.org/2024/06/hot-wash-pioneer-adjacent-pies-deployments/">deployed a few more</a>. Because the timeseries from the CPIES is relatively long, we can resolve both long-term (and likely mesoscale) and short-term (submesoscale) processes.  We published the Level 2 dataset and a first-look into the timeseries here:

* <a href="10.5281/ZENODO.12583849">Technical Report</a>

All of this has been part of the <a href="https://www.swot-adac.org/campaigns/mab-swot/">NASA Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) Adopt-A-Crossover Field Campaign</a>. The region where the 6 CPIES were deployed in a SWOT crossover region in the US East Coast, specifically in the Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB) where the Gulf Stream separates from the continental slope and begins to flow as a free-flowing jet to preserve its potential vorticity.
