        <p style="font-size: 14pt">Hello, my name is Ysabel Wang. I'm a third-year PhD candidate studying physical oceanography in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program. <br>
        My research involves making use of all available sources of information and data (in-situ measurements, satellite imagery, model output) to investigate the relationship between the well-studied large-scale, long-term, and surface-expressed physical processes and the more elusive fine-scale, short-term, and often subsurface ocean processes that have a cumulatively significant impact on heat, salt, and nutrient budgets in the Northwestern Atlantic ocean.</p>
