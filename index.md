<p style="font-family: avenir;text-align: left;font-size: 17pt">Hello, my name is Ysabel Wang. I'm a third-year PhD candidate studying physical oceanography in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program.</p>

***

<p style="font-family: avenir;text-align: left;font-size: 17pt">My research involves making use of all available sources of information and data (in-situ measurements, satellite imagery, model output) to investigate the relationship between the well-studied large-scale, long-term, and surface-expressed physical processes and the more elusive fine-scale, short-term, and often subsurface ocean processes that have a cumulatively significant impact on heat, salt, and nutrient budgets in the Northwestern Atlantic ocean.</p>

<!-- Hello, my name is Ysabel Wang. -->
<!-- My name is **Xuankai Wang**. I am currently a first-year [Statistics](https://www.sfu.ca/stat-actsci.html) master student at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/), advised by Professor [Donald Estep](https://canssi.ca/don-estep/). Previously, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Statistics from the [School of Mathematics](https://math.nwu.edu.cn/), [Northwest University](https://www.nwu.edu.cn/) in 2025. I was born in [Zhoushan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhoushan), Zhejiang Province, People's Republic of China in 2003. <br> -->

<!-- ## Academic Interests

****

My interests primarily focus on applying solid mathematical knowledge, especially **probability theory, stochastic processes, stochastic analysis and statistics** to develop stochastic and statistical models for addressing crucial real-world problems and interpreting real-world phenomena.

Note that when we talk about **applied probability**, we are still inclined to the theoretical part, e.g., mathematical statistics, statistical physics, control theory, telecommunications, opinion dynamics, reliability, queueing theory, risk theory, game theory, prediction, filtering, financial mathematics, etc. On the other hand, **the application of probability** could just be a theorem or a practical use. Examples of applied probability that I find interesting include the Gambler’s Ruin, the Coupon Collector’s Problem, and the Secretary Problem. -->
