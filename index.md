## Academic Interests

****

My interests primarily focus on applying solid mathematical knowledge, especially **probability theory, stochastic processes, stochastic analysis and statistics** to develop stochastic and statistical models for addressing crucial real-world problems and interpreting real-world phenomena.

Note that when we talk about **applied probability**, we are still inclined to the theoretical part, e.g., mathematical statistics, statistical physics, control theory, telecommunications, opinion dynamics, reliability, queueing theory, risk theory, game theory, prediction, filtering, financial mathematics, etc. On the other hand, **the application of probability** could just be a theorem or a practical use. Examples of applied probability that I find interesting include the Gambler’s Ruin, the Coupon Collector’s Problem, and the Secretary Problem.
